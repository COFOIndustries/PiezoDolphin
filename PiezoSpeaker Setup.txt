How to Set Up the Piezoelectric Speaker:
1. Connect the Piezoelectric Speaker to the Raspberry Pi

The piezoelectric speaker has two pins, and you’ll connect them to the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO.

    Positive ( + ) Pin: Connect this pin to one of the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO output pins (e.g., GPIO18).
    Negative ( - ) Pin: Connect this pin to a GND (ground) pin on the Raspberry Pi.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on wiring:

    Identify which pin on the piezo speaker is positive and which is negative.
    Use jumper wires to connect:
        Positive pin of the piezo speaker to GPIO18 (or another GPIO pin of your choice).
        Negative pin of the piezo speaker to GND on the Raspberry Pi.
    Optionally, place a resistor between the positive terminal and the GPIO pin to limit the current.

Pin Layout Example:

    GPIO Pin 18 (PWM output) → Positive Pin of piezo
    GND → Negative Pin of piezo
